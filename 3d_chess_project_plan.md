# 3D Chess Game Project Plan

## Step 1: Project Planning
- **Set clear goals and requirements**:
  - Single-player vs. multiplayer (Stockfish integration or just against another player)
  - 3D board and pieces rendered in Three.js
  - Smooth animations for piece movement
  - User interface (move history, whose turn it is, etc.)
  - Optional: custom environments for the chess scene
- **Decide on technologies**: 
  - Three.js for 3D visuals
  - chess.js for game logic
  - Socket.io for multiplayer (if applicable)
  - Stockfish for AI
- **Break down tasks**: 
  - Set up Three.js environment
  - Implement chess.js logic
  - Design user interface
  - Integrate multiplayer (Socket.io)
  - Set up Stockfish backend

## Step 2: Set Up the Development Environment
- **Initialize your project**: Set up your code repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and initialize a basic Node.js project (or whatever backend framework you're using).
  - Install necessary dependencies: Three.js, chess.js, Socket.io, express, etc.
- **Set up folder structure**: Keep separate folders for backend and frontend, and organize your assets (models, textures, scripts).
- **Create a basic server**: For now, set up a basic Express server to serve the front-end files.

## Step 3: Create the Chess Board & 3D Environment in Three.js
- **Start with the chessboard**: 
  - Create a basic chessboard grid in Three.js.
  - Position squares properly using a grid system (8x8).
  - Add materials to the squares for alternating light/dark squares.
- **Load the 3D models**: 
  - Import your Blender-exported models (chess pieces) into Three.js (use .glb for easy import/export with Blender).
  - Position the pieces on the correct squares (initial setup of a chessboard).
  - Add simple lighting to illuminate the scene.

## Step 4: Implement Piece Movement
- **Piece selection & movement**: 
  - Allow users to select pieces by clicking on them.
  - Display valid moves for the selected piece (using chess.js logic).
  - Animate the piece movement from one square to another using Three.js.
- **Handle legal moves**: 
  - Use chess.js to validate the legality of the moves.
  - If the move is valid, animate the piece moving to that square.
  - If invalid, return the piece to its original position or show visual feedback (e.g., a red outline).

## Step 5: Create the User Interface (UI)
- **Basic UI elements**:
  - Display who's turn it is.
  - Show a move history (in chess notation).
  - Add buttons for options like starting a new game or resigning.
- **Game Over UI**: Create a modal or text that appears when a player wins, draws, or resigns.
- **Optional (Multiplayer UI)**: Include chat, player info, etc., for multiplayer.

## Step 6: Set Up Multiplayer (If Applicable)
- **WebSockets with Socket.io**: 
  - Start by setting up a simple communication system where Player 1 can make a move, and Player 2 can receive and see the move in real-time.
  - Build out basic message handling between players: when one player makes a move, broadcast the updated board to both players.
- **Game State Management**: 
  - Make sure the server maintains the game state (whose turn it is, piece positions) and synchronizes with both clients in real-time.
  - Store the current state of the game in a variable or a database.

## Step 7: Integrate Stockfish AI
- **Set up the Stockfish backend**:
  - Stockfish runs as a standalone executable or server, so set it up on a separate backend.
  - If using Node.js, you can use `child_process` to communicate with the Stockfish engine by sending UCI commands (for moves and analysis).
- **Integrate Stockfish with frontend**:
  - On the frontend, create a button to play against Stockfish (or automatically switch to Stockfish when it's the AI's turn).
  - Send the current game state to the backend, request Stockfish’s move, and return that move to be animated on the board.

## Step 8: Smooth Animations & Polish
- **Smooth piece movement**: 
  - Use Tween.js or GSAP to create smooth transitions for piece movements on the board.
  - Animate the camera (zooming in when a piece is selected or following the piece as it moves).
- **Post-processing effects**: 
  - Add post-processing effects (like a subtle bloom effect, shadows) in Three.js to enhance the visual quality.
- **Environment customization**: 
  - Create different themes for the chessboard (space, medieval castle, etc.) and add unique lighting or textures.

## Step 9: Testing and Debugging
- **Test all interactions**: Go through the game as a user. Test every possible scenario: piece movement, game-ending conditions, multiplayer interactions, and AI responses.
- **Bug fixes**: Track down and fix any bugs related to UI, animations, multiplayer, or logic.

## Step 10: Deployment
- **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy the front-end to Netlify or Vercel (if it’s just static assets).
- **Backend Deployment**: Host your backend on Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS. Make sure WebSocket connections are properly handled for multiplayer.
- **Final testing**: Test the game in a live environment, especially multiplayer and AI interaction.

## Bonus Features (Optional)
- **Player rankings**: Implement a ranking system where players earn points based on wins and losses. Store this data in a database.
- **Time control**: Add the ability to play with a time control, like a chess clock (Blitz or Bullet modes).
- **Chess puzzle mode**: Add a puzzle mode where the user must solve a chess problem (e.g., checkmate in 3 moves).
